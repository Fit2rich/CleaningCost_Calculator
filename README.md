Users can input specific details, such as distance, square footage, number of beds, visitors, and bathrooms, to receive an estimated cost for cleaning services, including additional service charges.

This application is built to be easy to use and helps individuals or businesses quickly estimate cleaning service costs based on customizable inputs.
